> 🪐 *Exploring exoplanets and comparing their atmospheric properties with Earth using spectrogram data.*

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔭 Analyze spectrograms of exoplanets
- 🌍 Compare planetary environments with Earth
- 🧪 Estimate percentage of habitability
- 🚀 Supports James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data

---

## 🛰️ Project Overview
ExoHabit is designed to process spectrogram datasets from JWST to analyze atmospheric composition and predict habitability.  
Our model leverages deep learning to map exoplanet spectrogram signatures to Earth’s known data and generate a habitability index.
